\section{Core concepts of the \gls{rec}}
\label{sec:design}

In order to set a context we will first give a broad overview of how the discussed recommender computes a \gls{topn}.
The conceptual process can be divided into five steps. Figure \ref{fig:topndataflow} illustrates this simplified view.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A user requests a \gls{topn}.
\item The recommender looks up items that appear in the recent user history. The history contains multiple types of past user actions.
\item A query composed of items from the user's action history is sent to the search engine.
\item The search engine returns a ranked search result set of items according to the query. The search result contains recommendable items.
\item The recommender removes items already known to the user and presents him a \gls{topn}.
\end{enumerate}

In this section we deal mainly with step 4, the \gls{rankedretrieval} and hence the scoring of items with respect to a user's history.
A recommender needs some data in order to build a model, also called training data. 
First we describe the kind of training data used by the \gls{rec}. 
Then we explain how the \gls{topn} is computed in theory and why we use the \gls{llr} ratio of \glspl{coocc} as a similarity metric.
Next we show the similarities of the \gls{topnt} and a \gls{rankedretrieval}, how we map items to documents stored in Solr and how we extend Solr's scoring function to match our needs.
