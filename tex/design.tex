\section{Core concepts of the \gls{rec}}
\label{sec:design}

In order to set a context we will first give a broad overview of how the discussed recommender executes top-N recommendation task.
The conceptual process of procucing a \gls{topn} can be divided into five steps. Figure \ref{fig:topndataflow} illustrates this simplified view.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A user requests a \gls{topn}.
\item The recommender looks up items that appear in the recent user history. The history contains multiple types of past user actions.
\item A query composed of user's action history is sent to the search engine.
\item The search engine returns a ranked search result set of items according to the query. Because a \gls{rankedretrieval} is a way of finding similar documents according to a query we can use \gls{rankedretrieval} to find similar items to the ones the user already exressed some interest.
 We uses similarity indicators based on \gls{coocc} to score every items that matches the query.
\item The recommender removes item already known to the user and present him a \gls{topn}.
\end{enumerate}

In this section we deal mainly with the step 4, the scoring of items with respect to a user's history.
A recommender needs some data in order to build a model, also called training data. 
First we describe the kind of training data used by the \gls{rec}. 
Then we explain how the \gls{topnt} works in theory and why we use the \gls{llr} ratio of \glspl{coocc} as a similariy metric.
Next we describe the similarities of the top-N recommender task and a \gls{rankedretrieval} and how we extend the scoring function depending on the precomputed similarity strength among items.
