\subsection{Why can we use a search engine to produce \gls{topn}?}
\label{sec:relation}

The \gls{rec} uses a search engine to produce a \gls{topn}. We can deploy a search engine in order to provide recommendations because there are similarities between the computation of the \gls{topnt} and the retrieval of a ranked search result set.
 This section explains why the deployment of a search engine is suitable for the top-N recommendation task.

\caption{The precision and recall at 10 for the MovieLens data set is measured as a function of the similarity threshold. Items with a small similarity value do not contribute to the performance. The best performance is archieved by only adding items with a \gls{llr} ratio above 0.9.}
\label{fig:threshold}
\end{figure}


In our demo web application we only add items above a given \gls{llr} ratio threshold to the index of the search engine. If we add items with a small similarity to the indicator fields the precision and recall decline. The evaluation in figure \ref{fig:threshold}shows that the we archieve the best performance with a threshold of 0.9.
