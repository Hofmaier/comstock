\subsection{Why can we use a search engine to produce a top-N recommendations list?}
\label{sec:relation}

The \gls{rec} uses a search engine to produce a \gls{topn}. We can deploy a search engine in order to provide recommendations because there are similarities between the computation of the \gls{topnt} and the retrieval of a ranked search result set.
 This section explains why the deployment of a search engine is suitable for the top-N recommendation task.

\subsubsection{Similarity threshold}

In our demo web application we only add items above a given \gls{llr} ratio threshold to the index of the search engine. If we add items with a small similarity to the indicator fields the precision and recall decline. The evaluation in figure \ref{fig:threshold}shows that the we archieve the best performance with a threshold of 0.9.
