 In order to build the evaluator run the maven command

mvn clean compile assembly:single

This creates an executable jar archive. To start the evaluation run 

java -jar target/evaluator-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar

The program expects the following parameters:

- precisionat: Set the size $N$ of the top-N list.
- Solr instance:  URL of the Solr instance.
- Ratings filepath: File path of a CSV file that contains user ratings
- Tags filepath: File path of a CSV file that contains tag - item interactions.

The shell script startevaluator.sh starts an example evaluation.
